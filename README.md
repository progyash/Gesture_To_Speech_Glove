# Sign Language to Speech Glove 🤖🧤🔊

This Arduino-based project converts sign language gestures into speech using flex sensors and a DFPlayer Mini audio module. It is designed to assist individuals with hearing or speech impairments by providing an accessible, offline communication tool.

## 👨‍💻 Project Description

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino (Uno/Nano)
- **Sensors**: 5x Flex Sensors (connected to A0–A4)
- **Audio Output**: DFPlayer Mini with microSD card and speaker
- **Communication**: Offline, no internet required
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `SoftwareSerial.h`
  - `DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h`

Each finger is mapped to a specific audio track that plays when the finger is bent beyond a calibrated threshold.

## 🛠️ Features

- Calibrates baseline values for flex sensors at startup
- Detects bending of each finger individually
- Plays pre-recorded audio clips corresponding to each gesture
- Ignores further input while audio is playing
- Displays readings and threshold status in Serial Monitor

### 📣 Note

Make sure your SD card contains audio files named in `001.mp3`, `002.mp3`, ..., `005.mp3` format corresponding to each finger.
